Website Bio of James Stacy Jones.

Over the 12 years I have been coding and building projects varying from SEO ( search engine optimization ) to Web Development ( client side languages ) to Coding ( server languages ) and decided that it is time to reflect on those different areas for 2 main reasons.

2. Helps me remember them too. ;)
